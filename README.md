# Facebook-Add-Hack
A simple one-liner to remove Facebook ads and garbage.
Only tested in Chrome.

I haven't used FB in years and recently started again. I missed most of my friends back home's posts between all the garbage so, I threw this together.
Took me like 5 minutes and it might not work in a few months or a year but, then I'll just change it accordingly.

NOTE: You need to restart the snippet ever so often. Like if you refresh the page. This is easy. Just open the inspector and use the arrow key UP. The snippet will be retreived from the history. Then hit enter to restart it. Maybe I'll make an extension.

1. Copy the code from [app.js](app.js)
2. In Chrome right-click and pick "Inspect".
3. Click the "Console" tab.
4. Ignore the warning ( this isn't going to hurt anything except maybe Zuck's bottom-line ... yeah right :smirk: )
5. Paste the code
6. Enjoy!
